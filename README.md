# Alex Tjin . Jarvis Consulting

As a dedicated Data Engineer, I bring over three years of comprehensive IT development experience to the table. My expertise primarily revolves around data ingestion and integration, where I excel in leveraging Python, SQL, and Bash to seamlessly handle data workflows. I possess extensive knowledge of diverse databases, including Redshift, Oracle, and Postgres, allowing me to efficiently manage and manipulate data at scale. Furthermore, I have honed my skills in constructing robust Data Pipelines utilizing cutting-edge ETL tools like Informatica and Airflow. These tools enable me to orchestrate and automate complex data processes, ensuring streamlined data integration and efficient information flow. Also, I have acquired valuable exposure and hands-on experience with the three major cloud service providers AWS, Azure, and GCP, which enable me to design and implement scalable and performant data solutions that leverage the power and versatility of these platforms.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-alextjin/tree/masterhttps://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-alextjin/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Reduced the workload of the Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team by developing several scripts that track instance performance. I used Docker in implementation and testing to ensure consistent execution. The 'psql_docker.sh' script facilitates container creation and activation. 'host_info.sh' and 'host_usage.sh' extract platform details, with the latter scheduled using crontab for continuous data collection, minimizing manual intervention. All data is stored in a PSQL instance for future analytics. Git was utilized as the version control tool, with all project scripts accessible on GitHub for collaboration and transparency.


## Highlighted Projects
**RISE**: I played a significant role in an on-prem-to-cloud project that involved integrating new data sources. I actively contributed by establishing connections with these new data sources and constructing the project-specific database. This involved creating over 650 tables to facilitate efficient data storage and retrieval. Additionally, I designed and developed more than 20 ETL workflows using Informatica, ensuring smooth data transformations and transfers. To optimize operations, I leveraged Airflow and worked on more than 10 DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for workflow orchestration to ingest files from AWS S3 and send outbound files to different business users. Furthermore, I implemented bash scripts to automate tasks and monitor the performance of these workflows, enabling streamlined operations and efficient performance monitoring.
