# Alex Tjin . Jarvis Consulting

As a dedicated Data Engineer, I bring over 3 years of comprehensive IT development experience to the table. My expertise primarily revolves around data ingestion and integration, where I excel in leveraging Python, SQL, and Bash to seamlessly handle data workflows. I possess extensive knowledge of diverse databases, including Redshift, Oracle, and Postgres, allowing me to efficiently manage and manipulate data at scale. Furthermore, I have honed my skills in constructing robust Data Pipelines utilizing cutting-edge ETL tools like Informatica and Airflow. These tools enable me to orchestrate and automate complex data processes, ensuring streamlined data integration and efficient information flow. Also, I have acquired valuable exposure and hands-on experience with the three major cloud service providers: AWS, Azure, and GCP, which enable me to design and implement scalable and performant data solutions that leverage the power and versatility of these platforms.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_demo/tree/masterhttps://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-alextjin/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Reduced the workload of the Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team by developing several scripts that track instance performance. I used Docker in implementation and testing to ensure consistent execution. The 'psql_docker.sh' script facilitates container creation and activation. 'host_info.sh' and 'host_usage.sh' extract platform details, with the latter scheduled using crontab for continuous data collection, minimizing manual intervention. All data is stored in a PSQL instance for future analytics. Git was utilized as the version control tool, with all project scripts accessible on GitHub for collaboration and transparency.
