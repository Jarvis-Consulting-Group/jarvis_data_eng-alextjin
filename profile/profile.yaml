    description: Reduced the workload of the Linux Cluster Administration (LCA) team by developing several scripts that track instance performance. I used Docker in implementation and testing to ensure consistent execution. The 'psql_docker.sh' script facilitates container creation and activation. 'host_info.sh' and 'host_usage.sh' extract platform details, with the latter scheduled using crontab for continuous data collection, minimizing manual intervention. All data is stored in a PSQL instance for future analytics. Git was utilized as the version control tool, with all project scripts accessible on GitHub for collaboration and transparency.

  #  The project description must start with an action verb (https://bit.ly/3guO98u)
    description: I built a reusable scripts to handle XML to CSV conversion. lxml is adopted for parsing the data. The script can support parsing the data from different root and layer. All the parent and child data would be captured.
  - name: "IBOR (Investment Book of Record) Data Package"
    description: I was responsible to build data pipelines for the middle office book keeping. We retrieved data from our vendor via APIs request. I utilised AWS s3, Airflow and Spark for data ingestion, transformation and loading phases. Adopted Great Expectation for data quality checking.
  - name: "RISE"
    description: I played a significant role in an on-prem-to-cloud project that involved integrating new data sources. I actively contributed by establishing connections with new data sources and constructing the project-specific database. This involved creating over 650 tables to facilitate efficient data storage and retrieval. Additionally, I designed and developed more than 20 ETL workflows using Informatica, ensuring smooth data transformations and transfers. To optimize operations, I leveraged Airflow and worked on three DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) for workflow orchestration. Furthermore, I implemented bash scripts to automate tasks and monitor the performance of these workflows, enabling streamlined operations and efficient performance monitoring.
  - name: "Library System Management App"
    git_url:
    description: I built a library system management app designed to manage all the functions of a library. Users can do all the CRUD operations for books. The frontend is designed with Angular and the backend is held by Express Web Framework. I also adopted Angular Material, MySQL to enhance the web functionality and data storage. Unit test has benn conduct with Jest.
